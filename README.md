# Oware

This is a the beginnings a program to play [Oware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oware) (a sowing game related to [Mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala)) using reinforcement learning.

It's primarily a learning project to help me understand different approaches to RL, based on [Barto & Sutton's book](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). As a secondary goal, I'd like to explore the complexity of different rulesets of sowing games.

It isn't at all good yet.
